## Samples 

There are two projects uses this UI library: 

- [rusty-editor](https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rusty-editor/)
- [rusty-shooter](https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rusty-shooter)

However it can be too difficult to understand how to use library from those projects, so standalone samples should be added. This is still a TODO.
