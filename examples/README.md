# Examples

The engine contains examples for various aspects. Currently there is not much, but I'm working on it.

## Example 01 - Simple Scene

*Difficulty*: Easy.

## Example 03 - 3rd Person Walking Sumilator

*Difficulty*: Advanced.

This example based on async example, because it requires to load decent amount of resources which might be slow on some machines.

In this example we'll create simple 3rd person game with character that can idle, walk, or jump.

Also this example demonstrates the power of animation blending machines. Animation blending machines are used in all modern games to create complex animations from set of simple ones.

## Example 04 - User Interface

*Difficulty*: Medium

This example shows how to use user interface system of engine. It is based on simple.rs example because UI will be used to operate on model.
